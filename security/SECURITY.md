## Reporting a Security Issue

If you identify a security vulnerability, privacy risk, or risk of unintended data disclosure related to this repository, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report the issue confidentially by contacting:

- **Email:** vincent.straub@ndph.ox.ac.uk  

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- The potential impact (e.g. data exposure, reproducibility risk)
- Any suggested mitigations, if known

We will acknowledge receipt of security reports within a reasonable timeframe and work to assess and remediate the issue as quickly as possible.

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- Code and notebooks contained in this repository
- Documentation and configuration files
- Risks related to **analysis logic**, **summary outputs**, or **accidental disclosure pathways**

This repository **does not contain any raw, individual-level, or restricted-access data**.


## Data Protection and Privacy

- Restricted-access datasets (e.g. Our Future Health, UK Biobank) are **not included** in this repository.
- All analyses are designed to be run within approved secure research environments (e.g. DNAnexus TRE) or with locally configured access by authorised users.
- Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable data access agreements, institutional policies, and ethical approvals when running the notebooks.

If you believe that any code, documentation, or example output could inadvertently enable re-identification or misuse of restricted data, please report this immediately using the contact details above.



## Responsible Disclosure

We request responsible disclosure of security issues. Please allow reasonable time for investigation and mitigation before any public disclosure. Coordination on disclosure timing may be requested.


## Updates

This security policy may be updated as the project evolves or as new risks are identified.
